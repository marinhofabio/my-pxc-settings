These are the configuration files of my 5 nodes Percona XtraDB Cluster.
I am able to handle 50.000 concurrent connections on each node and the total that this cluster can handle reaches 250.000 concurrent connections.

I'm running this cluster on five Dell PowerEdge m630 with 48cpu + 128GB of memory.
